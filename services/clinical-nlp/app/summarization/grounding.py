"""Grounding validation for LLM-proposed summary bullets (Blueprint Section
11.1: "every extracted entity, symptom, and summary bullet must carry a
reference to the exact transcript span it came from. If an LLM-based
extractor cannot produce a valid span match, the item is discarded, not
shown.").

Two checks, both must pass:
1. Structural: `source_utterance_id` must reference an utterance that was
   actually in the transcript sent to the model. A citation to an id that
   doesn't exist (hallucinated or malformed) is an automatic discard --
   this is the primary, strictly-enforced check.
2. Lexical backstop: the bullet's text must have at least some overlap with
   the cited utterance's own text (English translation preferred, since
   bullets are written in English but the source utterance may be Hindi).
   This is a heuristic, not a strong guarantee -- a bullet could cite a
   real utterance_id while still summarizing/paraphrasing it inaccurately
   in a way this simple ratio check wouldn't catch. Real semantic grounding
   verification would need an embedding-similarity call, which is out of
   scope here; documented honestly as a backstop against flagrant
   mismatches (citing utterance A's id while writing content from
   utterance B), not a guarantee against subtle misrepresentation.
